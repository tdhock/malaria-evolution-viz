Plotted QUAL threshold error curves and chromosomes.

** TODO

exclude outliers?

plot error curves for other quality metrics?

dotplots of fp/fn versus chromosomal position for every amplicon
(maybe facets or showSelected).

plot HDR status as dot outline in chrom plot, and as a shaded band in
the dotplots.
