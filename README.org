Visualization of Malaria parasite genome evolution

Collaboration with https://github.com/zmartine

** TODO

figure-interactive: 
- add aligned reads plot. (data from bam file)
- add amplicon sizes.
- optimal segmentation for identifying HDRs?
- all bases on Sanger sequenced amplicons which are outside HDR/LCR
  and are not TP are actually negative examples! Use them to compute
  FPR and ROC.
